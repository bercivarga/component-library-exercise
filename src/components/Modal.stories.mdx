# Modals

Modals are designed to be informatory excerpts for users and guidance to other parts of the website.

## Usage

Use modals in combination with CTAs and other user events.

## Sign up modal

The sign up modal is meant to be used when a user performs an action that is sensible to follow up by a sign-up CTA.
